  <title>Supportability</title>
 </info>
 <para>
  This chapter explains how &slsa; container support plans work.
 </para>
 <para>
  There are three guiding principles that &suse; container supportability
  generally adheres to:
 </para>
 <orderedlist numeration="arabic">
  <listitem>
   <para>
    The container image lifecycle follows the lifecycle of the related
    products.
   </para>
   <para>
    For example, &slsa; &productnumber; container images will adhere to the
    &slsa; &productnumber; lifecycle.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Container release status also matches the status of the related product.
   </para>
   <para>
    For example, if &slsa; &productnumber; is in Alpha, Beta, RC or GA stage,
    the related containers also have that release status.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Containers are built only using the packages from the related products.
   </para>
   <para>
    For example, &slsa; &productnumber; container images will be built using
    the same packages as the main &slsa; &productnumber; release.
