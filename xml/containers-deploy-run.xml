  <para>
   Apart from being able to build images, Podman (see <xref linkend="podman"/>)
   also has a container deployment engine, which can be used for easier pod
   deployment. This engine works with the concept of pods - a group of one or
   more containers that operate together. Pods can also be thought of as a way
   to group related containers together for easier management. Because Podman
   deploys each container as its own process, this can be a very efficient and
   easy way of creating interconnected containers.
